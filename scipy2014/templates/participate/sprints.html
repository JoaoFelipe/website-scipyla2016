<h1>SciPy 2014 Sprints - Call for Submissions</h1>

<h2>Two Days of Awesome Hacking!</h2>

<p>SciPy 2014 will continue the tradition of two days of Code Sprints following the main conference program. Core developers of many of our favorite tools will be in town, so what better time to get involved with their development? Whether it’s your first time or your fiftieth, there’s nothing quite like sitting down at a table with people you may have only seen on mailing lists and Twitter. The SciPy sprint committee is calling for proposals for hosted sprints following the main sessions of the conference on July 11-12th.</p>
