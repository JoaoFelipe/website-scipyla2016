<h1>SciPy 2014 Financial Aid Applications</h1>

<p>
SciPy 2014 will continue the tradition of offering sponsorships to attend the conference. These sponsorships can provide funding for airfare, lodging, and conference registration. Like last year, these sponsorships will be open to community members and students.
    </p>

<p>
Applications will be judged both on merit as well as need. Although all attendees are eligible for sponsorships, we encourage applicants to consider their level of need before applying, such as whether their institution is covering some or all of their travel costs. As funds are limited, our goal is to bring together as many SciPy community members as possible. If only partial sponsorship is required, please indicate this in the application and we may be able to accommodate additional applicants due to such reasonable requests.
</p>


<h2>Instructions</h2>

<p>
Email the following information to: <a href="mailto:scipy2014-finaid@googlegroups.com">scipy2014-finaid@googlegroups.com</a>.
    </p>

<p>
Use the template below to apply for a sponsorship. The sponsorship can cover the costs of airfare, lodging, and registration or a subset thereof. A sponsorship request can be made for any member of the SciPy community who would otherwise not be able to attend the conference without financial assistance.
