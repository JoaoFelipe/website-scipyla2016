<h1>Diversity Events</h1>

    <p>SciPy2014 has a number of new events to support diversity at this year's conference.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Diversity luncheon on Wednesday, July 9th with speaker sponsored by NumFOCUS</li>
    <li>Increased support for diversity scholarships with NumFOCUS</li>
    <li>Partnering with PyLadies of Austin to advertise these activities</li>
    </ul>

<h1>Diversity Statement</h1>

<p>Our goal is to create an inclusive, respectful conference environment that invites 
participation from people of all races, ethnicities, genders, ages, abilities, 
religions, and sexual orientations. SciPy fully supports and endorses 
the Python Software Foundation's 
<a href="http://www.python.org/psf/diversity/">diversity statement</a>.</p>

<p>"The Python Software Foundation and the global Python community welcome and 
encourage participation by everyone. Our community is based on mutual respect, 
tolerance, and encouragement, and we are working to help each other live up to 
these principles. We want our community to be more diverse: whoever you are, and 
whatever your background, we welcome you."</p>

<p>We are actively seeking to increase the diversity of our attendees, speakers, and 
sponsors through our calls for proposals, other open submission processes, 
and through dialogue with the larger communities we serve.</p>

<p>This is an ongoing process. We are talking to our program chairs, program 
committees, and various innovators, experts, and organizations about this goal 
and about ways they can help us achieve it.</p>

<p>Here are some ways you can help us build a more diverse conference experience:</p>

<ul>
<li>Recommend appropriate speakers and/or program committee members to the conference 
chairs. </li>
<li>Forward our call for proposals to relevant affinity groups with the message that
we are looking for a diverse speaker roster.</li>
<li>Suggest to potential speakers that they submit a proposal during our Call for 
Proposals conference phase.</li>
<li>Organize community-based public speaking trainings and practice events </li>
<li>Suggest ways that the onsite conference experience can be more welcoming and 
supportive, free from intimidation and marginalization.</li>
<li>Share your ideas and best practices for how we can realize our vision.</li>
<li>We value diversity in the communities we bring together. We strive to provide 
balanced representation of the richness of our collective human experience, 
and welcome your contributions to helping us achieve that goal by following 
our code of conduct.</li>
</ul>

<p>You may always send an email to 
<a href="mailto:scipy-organizers@scipy.org">scipy-organizers@scipy.org</a>
with any question, comments, or concerns.</p>
